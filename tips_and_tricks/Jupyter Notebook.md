##Jupyter Notebook

More details here: [https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html) 
> tl;dr: Jupyter Notebook is a web-based utility to let you code with Python interactively. In addition, you can create and share notebook files so others can play around with your code in the same format.

Once you've created your `workspace` virtual environment, let's install Jupyter Notebook in it. (Be sure you've activated that venv. It should be showing on your command line prompt.)

Run the following command to install: `pip install notebook`

Then type this command to launch: `jupyter-notebook`

A couple things to note:

* Wherever you launch Notebook, you will only have access to files and folders beneath where you were when it launched, so make sure to launch it from your working folder where your notebook files live
* Probably some more things worth noting, will add later...
